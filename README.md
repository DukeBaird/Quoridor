SEBASTIAN THIS IS FOR YOU

Clone the develop directory onto your computer using git clone.

Assuming you have node installed (You will need to do this), run *node main.js* on the console to start the server.
Then in a browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080 to see the page that its serving up.

If you're going to do any work, create a feature branch (install git flow, use all default settings), and push your feature up and submit to me a pull request so that I can check it out. 

The only file you should need to edit is public/quoridor.js

Any questions send me a text.
